# Title 1. Staff Procedures and Policies

## Chapter 1.1. Appointment and removal of Staff members

### Section 1.1.1. Community Representative

¶1. **Term**. The Community Representative is to be elected by community vote for terms no longer than one (1) year. Should a CR resign their post, an election will be held early to replace their position, with the new Rep having their own one-year term. There are no term limits for the CR.

¶2. **Electorate**. All community members (non-bot users) present at the announcement of nominations will be eligible to vote. Votes cast by members who joined after this time will be accepted on a provisional basis unless rejected by Staff motion.

¶3. **Procedure of Election**. A nomination period will be held for no less than five (5) days, during which time nominations will be solicited from the electorate. Nominees will be asked if they accept their nomination. A campaign period may be held, the length of which shall not exceed two (2) weeks. After this time, a vote will be held using a sufficiently secure system over a period no less than two (2) days. Should no candidate obtain a majority (>50%) of the votes, those candidates with less than their share of votes (ie in a 4-person race, less than 25%) will be eliminated, and a runoff will be immediately held, lasting no less than two (2) days. This will repeat until a majority of votes go to a single candidate.

¶4. **Recalls**. In cases of gross negligence or extended absence, a recall election may be held. This may be initiated by Staff motion or by a petition from at least ten percent of the community membership (non-bot users). A recall vote will be held within two (2) weeks of this initiation, with a voting time lasting no less than two (2) days. Should a majority (>50%) of the voters vote to recall, the CR will be immediately removed from their position and an election will commence.

¶5. **Candidate Eligibility**. All community members are eligible to run for CR, with the following exceptions:

a) Current Moderators (if elected, they must forfeit their Mod position)
b) The former CR in an election immediately following a recall vote

### Section 1.1.2. Moderator

¶1. **Term**. Moderators hold no terms, and are selected as-needed and serve until their resignation or removal.

¶2. **Procedure of Appointment**. Moderators are appointed via Staff motion in the normal procedure. The appointee may decline this offer.

¶3. **CR Veto**. The Community Representative may at their discretion motion to veto the appointment of a proposed Moderator. In such cases, a vote will be held within two (2) weeks of the proposed veto, with a voting time lasting no less than two (2) days. Should a motion to veto pass (by a >50% majority of votes cast), then the proposed appointee will be blocked from joining the Staff.

¶4. **Vote of No Confidence**. The Community Representative may, in cases of gross negligence or abuse of privileges or extended absence, initiate a No Confidence vote for a current Moderator. In such cases, a public vote will be held within two (2) weeks of the call of No Confidence, with a voting time lasting no less than two (2) days. Should a No Confidence vote pass (by a >50% majority of votes cast), then the sitting moderator will be removed from their position.

¶5. **Normal Removal**. A moderator may also be removed via Staff motion in the normal procedure.

¶6. **Candidate Eligibility**. Community Representatives may not also be Moderators. A CR must resign their CR position before accepting an appoint to be a Moderator.

## Chapter 1.2. Moderator Code of Conduct

### Section 1.2.1. Conflicts of Interest

¶1. **Involvement in escalated disputes**. Moderators involved in a dispute as users shall not (where practical) make part in moderation actions due to the conflict of interest.

# Chapter 1.3. Deputization of Community Members

### Section 1.3.1. Community Rep Delegation

¶1. **Delegation is allowed**. The Community Representative is allowed do perform any sort of delegation of duties as they see fit, including appointing helpers or deputies.

### Section 1.3.2. Channel Moderation

¶1. **Channel Moderators**. Members participating heavily in specialized channels may petition the Staff for moderation privileges within a particular channel.

¶2. **Authority**. Channel Moderators are not Staff, and may not issue citations to users. They may, however, give their recommendations to Staff as they see fit.

¶3. **Delegated Powers**. Channel Moderators have wide-ranging authority to keep their channels in line, including deletion of messages and management of channel permissions. They may at their discretion remove users from their channel, enable slowmode, and other tasks as required.

¶4. **Appeals**. As with citations, a user can appeal a Channel Moderator's action to the Community Representative.
