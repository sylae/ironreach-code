This site contains the Ironreach Community Code (such that it is presently). Most of the Code is situation-specific or technical in nature, and is designed to be the more nitpickey version of the [Ironreach rules](https://canary.discord.com/channels/673383165943087115/747153470619910226/782526905109708810).

To request an addition to the Code, contact your Community Representative.
